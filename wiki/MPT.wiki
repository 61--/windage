== Introduction ==

The MPT (pronounced “Empty” or “Empty Box”) supplies cross-platform libraries for real-time perception primitives, including face detection, eye detection, blink detection, color tracking.


== To Build on Windows (Visual C++) ==
=== Configuring and installing the MPT environment ===
 1. Ensure that visual studio is not currently open
 1. Edit registry to allow visual studio to compile and dea with .cc files
  (go to *<MPT>\Libraries\mpisearch\windows* and double click cc.reg.)
 1. Download and Install DirectX 9.0 SDK from Microsoft (only needed for filters)
  * At now DirectShow(filters) is in Windows SDK
  1. Download from http://www.microsoft.com/downloads
  1. Go to *<DXSDK>\SAMPLES\C++\DirectShow\BASECLASSES* or *<WindowsSDK>\SAMPLES\Multimedia\DirectShow\BASECLASSES* and open baseclasses.dsw using Visual C++
  1. Build the baseclasses
 1. Add DirectShow libs and includes to Visual C++
  1. Open Visual C++
  1. Go to Tools -> Options -> Directories (Include Files)
   1. Add *<DXSDK>\Include* or *<WindowsSDK>\Include* and _move it to the top of the list_
   1. Add *<DXSDKSAMPLES\C++\DirectShow\BASECLASSES* or * <WindosSDK>\SAMPLES\Multimedia\DirectShow\BASECLASSES* and _move it below the top item in the list_
  1. Directories (Library Files)
   1. Add *<DXSDK>\lib* or *<WindowsSDK>\lib* and _move it to the top of the list_
   1. Add *<DXSDK>\SAMPLES\C++\DirectShow\BASECLASSES\Release* or * <WindosSDK>\SAMPLES\Multimedia\DirectShow\BASECLASSES\Release* and _move it below the second item in the list_

=== Building the MPT Project ===
 1. Mpisearch : Ablack and white, real time, frontal face finder using a Viola and jones syle approach.
 1. Eyefinder : an eedetector based on the mpisearch face detector
 1. Blinkdetector : Real time blink detection.
 1. Colortracker : A very face face tracker based on simple color features adapted based on information from a face detector running in parallel.
 1. MPutil : Utilites used to make code wokrk across multiple platforms
 * The projects are located on directories of the from *<MPT>\Librries\project_name\windows

=== Running the Projects
 1. Go to directory *<MPT>\Libraries\coloeleses.com* This registers the active X control and copies the appropriate executableinto the bin directory
